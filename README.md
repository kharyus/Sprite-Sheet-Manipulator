# Sprite Sheet Manipulator
Sprite Sheet Manipulator detects the boundaries of individual sprites in a Sprite Sheet and then saves them to individual files in the output folder.

In the near future I intend to create a button to generate a .json file containing the positions of the sprites in case you don't want to split the sheet into separate files.

# Features
Fast loading and saving times, even for huge files.
Intuitive User Interface.

# Dependencies
Sprite Sheet Manipulator was made in C++ and depends on the SFML library http://www.sfml-dev.org/ and TGUI https://tgui.eu/
