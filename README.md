# Sprite Sheet Manipulator
Sprite Sheet Manipulator detects the boundaries of individual sprites in a Sprite Sheet and then saves them to individual files in the output folder. It's also going to have a button to generate a .json file containing the positions of the sprites in case you don't want to split the sheet into separate files.

# Dependencies
Sprite Sheet Manipulator depends on the SFML library http://www.sfml-dev.org/ and TGUI https://tgui.eu/
